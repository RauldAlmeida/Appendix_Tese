# Appendix_Tese

Appendix of Dissemination entitled "Development of an Automatic System for Behavior Analysis of Orthodontic Loops".

## A - Arduino Code
[Open the following Paste](./arduino_code.ino/) to check the Arduino code used for motor and load cells control.
## B - Python Code
[Open the following Paste](./python_code.py/) to check the python interface designed using tkinter package. The interface communicate with Arduino and stires values of the motors and sensors embedded in the mechatronics system.


## C - AutoCAD Draw Files
[Open the following Paste](./2D%20Technical%20Draws/) to check the draws used for machining the metallic components to build up the mechanical system proposed in the final concept.

Note that each pdf. file contains the export drawing from SolidWorks with defined tolerances and rugosities according to ISO.

Apart from that, the components designations in each file are in Portuguese. The translation of each component designation drawed in each file is translated below:
- Placa Base = Base Sheet
- Tapa Motores = Motors Cover
- Tapa Eixos = Axes Cover
- Barra Angular = Angular Stacked Bar
- Corredi√ßa = Sliding Table
- Placa Base Barra Angular = Hinge of Angular Bar
- Olhal e Eixo do Sistema Angular = Ring nut and Angular Shaft
- Placa Aperto, Casquilho, Anel, Suporte Inferior, e Pino = Clamping Plate, Retainer Nut, Ring, Bottom Bracket, and Pivot.
